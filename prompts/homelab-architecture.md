### Subject

A vertical isometric cutaway of a three-story workshop building, viewed from the upper-right at a standard 30-degree isometric angle. The building is sliced open along its front face, revealing the interior machinery on each floor. The structure is built from warm sandstone-colored blocks with exposed copper piping connecting each level. The entire composition flows top-to-bottom, telling the story of raw materials being refined into finished product as they descend through the building.

### Environment

The building sits on a small isometric platform of dark slate, slightly elevated from the bottom edge of the frame. Behind and above the building, a calm gradient sky shifts from pale peach at the horizon to soft slate blue at the top of the frame, providing contrast without distraction. A single thin smokestack rises from the roof, releasing a gentle curl of steam that dissipates into the upper third of the composition.

### Top Floor -- The Intake Workshop

The uppermost level is a bright, airy workroom with pale wooden floors and open shelving along the back wall. On the shelves sit neat stacks of blueprint scrolls and flat document folders in muted teal, representing service manifests. A central workbench dominates the floor, where a craftsman's jig holds one unrolled blueprint. Copper tubes descend from the workbench through a circular opening in the floor, carrying material to the level below. The walls on this floor are painted a warm cream, and a single pendant lamp with a brass shade hangs above the workbench. Small gear mechanisms are visible where the copper tubes enter the floor opening, suggesting interpolation and merging.

### Middle Floor -- The Forge

The second level is darker and warmer, lit by the amber glow of a compact forge built into the back wall. The forge has a heavy iron door with visible rivets and a small viewing window emitting orange light, representing decryption and rendering. The copper tubes from above feed into a series of three connected glass vessels -- like alchemical retorts -- sitting on an iron rack. Liquid in the vessels shifts from cloudy amber on the left to clear blue on the right, visualizing the transformation from encrypted templates to rendered configuration. The clear blue liquid drains through a final copper pipe into the floor below. Stone walls on this level are darker, with iron brackets and tool hooks. A bellows mechanism sits beside the forge.

### Ground Floor -- The Dispatch Dock

The bottom level opens outward through a wide arched doorway at the front of the building. Inside, a simple wooden conveyor belt carries small, perfectly formed blue cubes -- each representing a deployed container -- from the pipe terminus toward the open archway. The cubes have a subtle inner glow, suggesting they are alive and running. Beyond the archway, three or four cubes sit neatly arranged on the slate platform outside, stacked in a small organized cluster. This floor has rough-hewn stone walls and warm lantern light from iron sconces flanking the archway.

### Lighting

Primary illumination comes from within each floor -- the pendant lamp on top, the forge glow in the middle, and the lantern sconces at the bottom -- creating three distinct warm pools of light contained within the building. Ambient fill comes from the soft sky gradient behind, casting a cool blue-gray tone on the building's exterior stone surfaces. The contrast between warm interior light and cool exterior creates depth and draws the eye inward through the cutaway. Shadows fall consistently toward the lower-left, reinforcing the isometric projection.

### Style

Clean isometric illustration with a slightly textured, hand-crafted feel -- as if rendered with gouache on heavy matte paper. Surfaces have subtle grain and gentle color variation rather than perfectly flat fills. Edges are crisp but not mathematically sharp, with the faintest softness suggesting human draftsmanship. The palette is constrained to five colors: sandstone cream for the building exterior, warm copper-orange for pipes and metalwork, deep slate blue for the sky and shadows, teal-green for the blueprint documents, and a luminous cerulean for the finished containers and clear liquid. Black is used sparingly for deep shadows and iron hardware only. The overall mood is industrious, warm, and quietly satisfying -- a well-oiled workshop where careful craftsmanship transforms raw plans into living systems.
