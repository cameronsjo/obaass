### Subject

A panoramic Rube Goldberg machine rendered as a clean, modern flat illustration, spanning the full width of an ultra-wide frame. The contraption flows left to right in five distinct stages, each mechanism impeccably engineered and visually precise. The entire elaborate chain reaction exists for one purpose: to keep a single glowing purple obsidian crystal alive inside a glass bell jar at the center of the composition. Every gear is perfectly placed. Every tube is immaculately routed. The whole thing is magnificently over-engineered, and it works.

### Environment

A seamless warm off-white background with no horizon line or ground plane — the machine floats in clean negative space like a technical illustration in a design annual. A single thin horizontal guideline in pale gray runs behind the machine at its vertical center, anchoring the chain reaction to a shared axis. The generous empty space above and below the mechanism is deliberate — the contraption is the only visual element, and the whitespace frames it like a museum exhibit of something that probably shouldn't exist but absolutely does.

### The Chain — Left to Right

The leftmost stage is the input: three small device silhouettes — a phone, a tablet tilted at a jaunty angle, and a laptop — rest on a tiny shelf. The phone has tipped forward, nudging a small blue marble off the shelf edge. The marble has just dropped onto the first of a series of copper-colored ramps and chutes that zigzag downward, passing through a miniature cloud shape rendered in pale blue glass — the sync relay.

The marble exits the cloud and rolls into the second stage: a security checkpoint. Three small gates in descending size stand in a row — a shield, a lock, and a bridge — each rendered in darker slate. The marble threads through all three gates in sequence, picking up speed on a slight downward slope.

The third stage is the centerpiece: the marble arrives at a glass bell jar sitting on a raised copper platform at the exact horizontal midpoint of the frame. Inside the bell jar, a faceted obsidian crystal glows with a deep purple inner light — luminous but contained, the only saturated color in the entire illustration. Leaning against the outside of the bell jar is a comically tiny monitor on a brass stand, its screen blank, propped up as if someone wanted the crystal to think it had a display. The marble drops into a funnel atop the bell jar and its energy transfers into the crystal's glow, causing it to pulse slightly brighter.

The fourth stage extends from the bell jar to the right: a clockwork copying mechanism. A small articulated brass arm extends from the base of the bell jar's platform, methodically stamping impressions of the crystal onto small teal-colored cards that stack neatly on a miniature conveyor belt. Each card has a tiny padlock embossed on its surface, indicating encryption.

The fifth and final stage: the conveyor belt carries the teal cards to the far right edge where they drop, one by one, into a sturdy rounded box with horizontal stripe details suggesting layered storage. The box sits solidly at the right margin, the final resting place — offsite backups, stacked and safe-ish.

### Lighting

No directional lighting — this is a flat illustration. The obsidian crystal provides the only luminance, casting a soft purple ambient halo within the bell jar that faintly tints the copper platform beneath it. The blue marble carries a subtle cool glow as it travels through the mechanism, leaving the faintest blue trail along its path. All other elements are matte and evenly lit, relying on color and shape for definition rather than shadow.

### Style

Clean modern flat illustration with geometric precision and generous whitespace — the aesthetic of premium developer documentation applied to a whimsical contraption. Shapes use consistent rounded corners and thin one-pixel borders in a slightly darker shade of their fill color. The palette is constrained to five roles: deep purple for the obsidian crystal alone, warm copper-gold for all mechanical parts and structural elements, cool blue for the marble and sync-related shapes, muted teal for the backup cards and storage, and neutral slate for the auth gates and device silhouettes. The background is warm off-white. No gradients except within the crystal's glow. The overall mood is quietly delighted — meticulous craftsmanship lavished on something beautifully unnecessary, presented with complete sincerity and zero apology.
